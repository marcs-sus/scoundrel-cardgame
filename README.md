# Scoundrel Video Game

This is a digital adaptation of the **Scoundrel** card game, a dungeon-crawling roguelike played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

## The Game

Scoundrel is a card game ruleset originally created by **Zach Gage** and **Kurt Bieg**.  
This project reimagines Scoundrel as a **digital game**, faithfully adapting its mechanics using the **Godot Engine with .NET**.

## Console Version

Before developing this version, I created a **console-based adaptation** that implements all core game mechanics.  
You can find it in [this repository](https://github.com/marcs-sus/scoundrel-ConsoleGame).

## Original Rules

For more details on the original game rules, refer to the [`OriginalRules.pdf`](./OriginalRules.pdf) file included in this repository.

## Features

- **Graphical user interface** for an enhanced gameplay experience
- **Faithful recreation** of the original mechanics in a digital format
- **52-card dungeon-crawling system** based on the classic deck structure
- **Developed in Godot** using its **.NET framework**
